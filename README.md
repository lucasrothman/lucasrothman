<h1>Lucas Rothman</h1>

Hi I'm Lucas, a computer science and economics student at <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/MIT_logo.svg" height="12px"></img>. 
I’ve previously worked at financial companies where I mainly modeled data in Python and Excel, but I’ve also experimented with algorithmic trading, built blockchains, and developed full-stack applications. 
Some of my projects are posted online at <a href="https://lucasrothman.com/" target="_blank">lucasrothman.com</a>.
